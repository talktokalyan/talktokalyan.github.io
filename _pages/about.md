I am Kalyan Kolukuluri, an Assistant Professor in Economics at the Indian Institute of Management Visakhapatnam. I teach economics and econometrics courses to MBA and PhD students. Over the years, I have taught Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and International Economics for MBAs (full-time and part-time). I also teach an Introductory Econometrics course for PhD students.

My research interests are in applied econometrics, particularly in investigating issues related to health and household economics. I am very interested in understanding the advances to causal inference theory and apply various methods to infer causation in secondary data. My work has been accepted at _Empirical Economics_ and the _International Journal of Health Economics and Management_.

I also develop teaching simulations in my spare time, an example of which is [here](https://tarangini.onrender.com/home).
