## Learning Resources I have developed
[_**Tarangini**_](https://tarangini.onrender.com/home){:target="_blank"} is a web based listing of teaching simulations I have developed. It is a work in progress. Tarangini can be used as a companion to visualize concepts in Economics & Econometrics. Example of some simulations, developed using Python and Dash framework:
* Economic cost functions
* Solow growth model
* Basic Utility maximization
* Central limit theorem
